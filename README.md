# MIPS-Tac-Toe
MIPS-Tac-Toe is easy to play, but for any confusion on how to play it, we have provided this user manual.

At the start of the game, you will be asked to choose whether you or the computer would like to move first. Enter either 1 for you or 2 for the computer.

You will then be asked whether you would like to play as X or O. In the same way, enter either 1 for X or 2 for O.

If you allow the computer to move first, the computer will select a move randomly. But if you decide to go first, it will be your move instead.

How do you make a move, you may ask?

Well, it's simple!

First, you will be asked to select a row. Enter 1 for the first row, 2 for the second row, or 3 for the third row.

Next, you will be asked to select a column. Enter A or a for the first column, B or b for the second column, and C or c for the third column.

Every move made updates the board.

Now how do you win the game, you may ask?

In tic-tac-toe, there are three ways to win. You can win by placing your marker three times in a row, three times in a column, or three times in a diagonal.

The game ends when either you or the computer win. The game also ends if you and the computer tie, or if the board is full and there are no moves left.

Once the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play another match. Just like before, enter 1 for yes or 2 for no.
